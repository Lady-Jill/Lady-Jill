### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jill, I'm fulltime streamer, incredibly love games and stuff. 

If you need voice actor, editor or RU|EN translator - you've come to the right place c:<br>
I'm pretty literate and good in classical Russian.<br>
My EN worse than my RU. I can't even speak EN because of nervous stuff, instead I read and type very well (so B1 I guess). But I'm good with finding information or solutions.

  If i'm not there - sleeping or dying then.
